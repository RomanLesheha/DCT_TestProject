Test Project for DCT company
This app includes 3 pages, the main page, the selected currency page, and the currency converter page.
I'll start with the main page. There is a table with all the currencies that are traded, two graphs,
the first one with the exchanges that have the largest volume (USD), and the second persent of the total volume on this page.
If you click on any currency in the currency table, a window  ,with detailed information about it ,will appear , namely its value history, 
which can be viewed at different intervals, for example, 1 minute, 1 hour or 1 day. 
Another graph shows you information about the value of this currency on various exchanges.
We can also see various information about this currency, its rank , supply etc.
Initially, the graph shows information about the value on ten exchanges, but with the help of the More and Less buttons, we can increase the number of exchanges.
If on the main page we click on the graph of the exchange for any one, we will see detailed information about it, also on the main page there are two fields for searching currencies and exchanges, 
with their help we can find the one we need.
In the detailed information about the exchange, there is a link to the website and if we click on it, we will go to this website in the browser.
The last window is the currency converter, you can go to it by clicking the button on the main window.
In this window, we can convert currencies, cryptocurrencies and also cryptocurrencies to currencies.

The project also includes three folders, namely with interfaces, classes, and images that I used.
Also I used  library LiveCharts ,with her help I built graphs.
